The task involves predicting the likelihood of diseases, in particular breast cancer, mental disorders and 
COVID-19, using classification models based on user-provided data. This is a controlled classification task 
in which the target variable represents the probability of making a specific diagnosis. The project 
includes comprehensive research data analysis (EDA), feature extraction, and the application of Bayesian 
Networks, implemented both from scratch and using library, to obtain accurate predictions. The system 
is designed to help users identify potential health problems at an early stage before contacting a doctor, 
providing valuable advance information about their health status. By facilitating early diagnosis, this 
model improves the decision-making process in the healthcare sector, gives users the opportunity to take 
active steps to seek professional medical advice and contributes to improving health indicators.
